#+title: Clojure on The Beagleboard
#+tags: clojure beagleboard

After three months of waiting finally my beagleboard arrived
(thank you TI for being really really slow), usually my distribution
of choice is [[http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardDebian][Debian]] but for some reason Debian's net install kept
failing so I decided to just grab the [[http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu#Demo_Image][Ubuntu image]] and start playing
with it.

There was nothing special about getting Clojure to run on the
beagleboard, /apt-get/ to install OpenJDK and /lein/ to handle Clojure
installation. Below is a simple benchmark to give you an idea about
its performance. Keep in mind that even though the xM has a 1 GHz CPU,
Ubuntu kernel does not have the digital voltage scaling patches so the
board was running at 500 MHz.

#+begin_src clojure
  (ns benchmark.core)
  
  (defn factorial [x]
    (reduce * (range 1 (inc x))))
  
  (defn fib [n] 
    (if (<= n 1) 
      1
      (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
  
  (defn sort-seq []
    (sort (repeat 100000 (rand-int 2000000))))
  
  (defn time-it [fn]
    (let [values  (for [i (range 200)] (with-out-str (time (fn))))
          doubles (map #(Double. (nth (.split % " ") 2)) values)]
      (/ (apply + doubles) (count doubles))))
  
  (defn -main []
    (println "(factorial 5000) \t Avg: " (time-it #(factorial 5000)))
    (println "(fib 20) \t Avg: " (time-it #(fib 20)))
    (println "(sort-seq) \t Avg: " (time-it #(sort-seq))))
