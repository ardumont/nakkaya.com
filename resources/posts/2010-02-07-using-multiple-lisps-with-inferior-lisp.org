#+title: Using Multiple Lisps with Inferior Lisp
#+tags: emacs

I was reading [[http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html][On Lisp]] which uses [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]] through out the book, so
I needed a quick way to switch between lisps, following is a quick
hack to switch between different lisp programs. When you call
na-run-lisp without any prefix it will run the first item in
lisp-programs, when called with a prefix you can select which lisp to
run.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq lisp-programs 
        (list (list "clojure" clojure-command)
              (list "sbcl" "/opt/local/bin/sbcl")))
  
  (defun na-run-lisp (arg)
    (interactive "P")
    (if (null arg)
        (run-lisp (second (first lisp-programs)))
      (let (choice) 
        (setq choice (completing-read "Lisp: " (mapcar 'first lisp-programs)))
        (dolist (l lisp-programs)
          (if (string= (first l) choice)
              (run-lisp (second l)))))))
#+end_src
