Arduino IDE is good, but if you are heavily invested in any other editor
such as Emacs or Vim, it just sucks. However there is an option to use an
external editor to do the coding and just use the IDE to compile and
upload.

External editor option is not documented very well. What happens when
you enable it is, it will disable editing on the file so you can use your
favorite editor (emacs for me) to do your coding and use the IDE just
for compiling and uploading.
