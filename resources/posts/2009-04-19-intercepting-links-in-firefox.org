#+title: Intercepting Links in Firefox
#+tags: firefox javascript

While working on a Firefox extension I needed to intercept links Firefox
is about to open and stop it on certain conditions. While it seems like
an easy task it took more time then I thought due to not much
information was available online. I saw the question asked multiple
times with no definitive answer. Correct recipe turns out to be using a
observer and listen for an "http-on-examine-response".

Following script will listen all request and you will have a chance to
stop the transmission based on your rules.

#+begin_src javascript
  var observer = {
      observe: function(subject,topic,data){
          
          var httpChannel = 
              subject.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIHttpChannel);
          var contentType = httpChannel.getResponseHeader("Content-Type");
          
          var channel = subject.QueryInterface(Components.interfaces.nsIChannel);
          var url = channel.URI.spec;
          url = url.toString();
          
          if ( isDownloadable( url ) == true 
               &&  contentType.indexOf("html") == -1 ){
  
              window.getBrowser().stop();
              
              download( url );
          }
      }
  };
  
  var observerService =
      Components.classes["@mozilla.org/observer-service;1"]
      .getService(Components.interfaces.nsIObserverService);
  observerService.addObserver(observer,"http-on-examine-response",false);
#+end_src

I am no extension guru, so maybe it is not the best way to do it but it
gets the job done.
