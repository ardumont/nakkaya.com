#+title: Holonomic Control
#+tags: clojure arduino robotics

Following snippets shows how to control a robot with omnidirectional
wheels. Holonomic wheels are wheels with 2 degrees of freedom. They are
also known as omni-directional drive wheels, omni-wheels or omniwheels
which ever floats your boat.

Omniwheels allows movement in any direction, at any angle, without
rotating beforehand. For an omniwheel robot to translate at a certain
angle, each motor needs to go at a certain speed in relation to the
other motors. Speed doesn't matter, just the ratios and to rotate at
some particular speed, we must add or subtract equally from the motor
speed of each motor.

These ratios can be calculated using the following formula assuming /n >
3/, 

|   |                 |       |   | \lceil  | -- sin\theta_1 cos\theta_1 1 | \rceil  |        |   |             |     |
| [ | v_1 v_2 v_3 v_4 | ]^T = |   |         | -- sin\theta_2 cos\theta_2 1 |         | \times | [ | v_x v_y R_w | ]^T |
|   |                 |       |   |         | ..   ..   ..  ..   ..   ..   |         |        |   |             |     |
|   |                 |       |   | \lfloor | -- sin\theta_n cos\theta_n 1 | \rfloor |        |   |             |     |

The idea is really simple, in a nutshell each motor pushes the robot
in two directions /X/ and /Y/ (their /sin/ and /cos/
components). Basically we are looking for the combination of motor
speeds v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, that when combined gives us v_x, v_y.

All the angles of the motor axis are measured relative to the /x/
direction in the coordinate system of the robot. Each rotating the
robot in counter counterclockwise direction.

#+begin_src clojure
  (def *wheel-angles* [60 135 225 300])
#+end_src

The intended direction of travel of the robot is calculated by the
control system in terms of V_x, V_y and R_w.

#+begin_src clojure
  (defn velocity-coupling-matrix [& n]
    (reduce (fn[h v]
              (conj h [(- (Math/sin (Math/toRadians v)))
                       (Math/cos (Math/toRadians v)) 1])) [] n))
  
  (defn motor-ratios [vcm x y r]
    (flatten (matrix-seq (matrix-multiply (matrix vcm) (matrix [[x][y][r]])))))
#+end_src

Multiplying velocity coupling matrix with our intended direction of
travel results in a sequence of motor speed ratios.

At this point you have couple of options for movement,

#+begin_src clojure    
  (let [vcm (apply velocity-coupling-matrix *wheel-angles*)
        base-rps 300]
    (defn motor-speeds [{x :x y :y} r]
      (map #(* base-rps %) (motor-ratios vcm x y r))))
#+end_src

Calculate a normalized vector to your target and multiply that with a
base motor speed.

#+begin_src clojure
  (def *max-velocity* 5)
  (def *slowing-dist* (* 5 *robot-width*))
  
  (defn arrive [self target velocity]
    (let [to-target (- target self)
          dist (magnitude to-target)
          ramped-speed (* *max-velocity* (/ dist *slowing-dist*))
          clipped-speed (min ramped-speed *max-velocity*)
          desired-velocity (* to-target (/ clipped-speed dist))]
      (- desired-velocity velocity)))
#+end_src

Or calculate proper velocity that will get you to your target. Above
is the arrive behavior from [[http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/][Steering Behaviors For Autonomous
Characters]], you can then convert that velocity to motor speeds using the
following formula, assuming your velocity is in meters/second you can
convert it to radians/second using,

W = (2 * v) / d

where,

   - w -> angular speed (rad/sec)
   - v -> linear speed (meter/sec)
   - d -> diameter (meter)

#+begin_src clojure
  (def *wheel-diameter* 0.054)
    
  (let [vcm (apply velocity-coupling-matrix *wheel-angles*)
        angular-velocity #(/ (* 2 %) *wheel-diameter*)]
    (defn motor-speeds [{x :x y :y} r]
      (motor-ratios vcm
                    (angular-velocity x)
                    (angular-velocity y)
                    (angular-velocity r))))
#+end_src

One thing that will bite you if you are not careful is that as the
robot's orientation changes, orientation of the robot's /x/ axis also
changes, so the controller needs to account for that.

Matrix operations (from commons-math),

#+begin_src clojure 
  (defn matrix [seq]
    (Array2DRowRealMatrix. (into-array (map double-array seq))))
  
  (defn matrix-multiply [a b]
    (.multiply a b))
  
  (defn matrix-seq [m]
    (map seq (.getData m)))
#+end_src
